Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrone integer. 

An integer is a __palinedrone__ when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is a palidrome while `123` is not. 

__Example 1:__
```python
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__
```python
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palidrome.
```

__Example 3:__
```python
Input: x = 10
Output: false
```

__Example 4:__
```python
Input: x = -101
Output: false
```

__Constraints__

-2 <sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2 <sup>31</sup> - 1
